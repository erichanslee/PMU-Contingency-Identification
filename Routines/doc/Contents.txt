Analyze contingencies in 14-bus test case by analyzing empirical modes.

Classes:
Instance 		-An instance holds all data, including jacobians, PMU data, and contingency lists
Metadata		-Simply a class for holding all metadata
Trial			-Wrapper class to store contingency matrices

Contigs:
	Contains Contig Data in PSAT format

Figures:
	Figures and Figure Generation Scripts for reports and papers

Data: 
	PMU Data of Contingencies as simulated from the PSAT

Observer:
	Observer stuff, still incomplete

Doc: 
	Documentation and such

Simulation:
	Workspace folder for Data and Jacobian Matrices

Tests:
	Misc Tests. Many for figure generation and/or unit tests

Unit Tests:
	OUTDATED

PSAT analysis:
	assessContig	- Cycles through Jacobian Matrices to ID contingency 
	calcEvalOrder
	place_PMU       - Given PMU indices, calculates idx of all visible buses
	gen_PMUidx		- From a PMU determines the buses it can obtain signals from
	run_n4sid       - Runs n4sid and extracts empirical eigenpairs
	run_observer	- given Gain and System matrices, calculates observer
    normalizematrix - Scale matrix columns to unit norm
    matrix_write    - Write a matrix to file (dense or sparse)
    matrix_read     - Read a matrix from file (dense or sparse)
 	printvec		- Print eigenvectors for comparison
 	filter_eigpairs	- Filters eigenpairs given frequency range
 	LSfit			- Least Squares fit of eigenpairs to signal
